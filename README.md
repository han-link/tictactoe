## TicTacToe Game Rules
This is a standard TicTacToe game with a twist. The rules are as follows:
- Two players take turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid with burger or donut. 
- The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- Special rule: On the third move (and onwards), the oldest of the last three moves is removed from the board.
